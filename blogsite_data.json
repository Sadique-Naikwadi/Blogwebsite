    "body": "In the aftermath of Hamas’s October 7th terrorist attack, Israel’s military has been bombing the Gaza Strip, where it has killed more than three thousand Palestinians. Tensions are also mounting in the West Bank, where several dozen Palestinians have been killed since last week. While the media’s focus has, understandably, been on the more than thirteen hundred Israeli victims of the initial attack, and on Palestinian civilians now facing siege and aggression in the occupied territories, there are two million Palestinians living inside Israel itself, making up approximately twenty per cent of the country’s population.\r\n\r\nI recently spoke by phone with Amjad Iraqi—an editor at +972 Magazine and a policy analyst at the think tank Al-Shabaka who comes from a family of Palestinian citizens of Israel—to discuss how Palestinian Israelis are reckoning with this month’s events, and what the war may mean for their future. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we also discussed the distinct forms of discrimination that Palestinian citizens of Israel face, how the relationship among different Palestinian communities has changed over time, and what Hamas’s tactics mean for any future state that recognizes equal rights for its inhabitants.",

    "body": "Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, the cyber domain has played a critical role in the conflict, albeit in ways the world may not have expected. Immediately following the attacks from Hamas on October 7th, social media became a hotbed of disinformation, inaccurate self-described OSINT investigators, and public confusion. Unfortunately, leading social media platforms continue to fail at stopping the spread of disinformation regarding this war. We will continue to see it abused as a go-to method to sway public perception of events with no signs of it ending soon.\r\n\r\nHowever, outside of social media information abuse and opportunistic-hacktivism, we must not forget the likelihood of targeted attacks originating from specific, state-sponsored threat actors. Understanding and closely monitoring all-aspects of the quickly evolving conflict within the digital domain is critical as such targeted attacks will translate into real-world consequences. While we continue to collaborate privately with partners, we also seek to bolster the wider industry knowledge about where to place our efforts.\r\n\r\nThis is an updated compendium of actors for cybersecurity researchers, analysts, and network defenders to watch closely. These actors have potential for significant involvement as the war continues, including APTs across Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran-based clusters of activity. While state-sponsored APTs should remain a strong focus, we must also carefully monitor the increasingly common use of hacktivist personas used to cloak state-sponsored operations.\r\n\r\nIn this post, we share recommended and publicly accessible information in effort to streamline the community’s understanding of relevant actors across historical reports for reference. In addition, we are sharing our perspective of public actor naming overlaps. Please note that each source of public reporting may perform attribution and actor clustering uniquely from their perspective.

    "body": "The definition of healthy eating has changed for me a couple of times in the past few years.\r\n\r\nBy the time I was in college, healthy eating was about following nutritional guidelines and doing everything by the book. However, it meant that my view of the food on my plate had changed. I went from seeing meals I enjoyed to only seeing nutrients.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, I went from seeing traditional Costa Rican gallo pinto — or rice and beans — to seeing complex carbs and plant-based proteins.\r\n\r\nThen, when I started practicing as a nutritionist, the notion that a dietitian should look a certain way or fit into a specific body type led me to believe that healthy eating meant measuring my food to know exactly what I was consuming. I would eat whatever I wanted, as long as the nutrients I needed were accounted for.\r\n\r\nI gave my body everything it needed to be healthy, but healthy eating goes beyond the nutrients. It’s also about how it makes you feel, and with food being an essential part of culture and social events, eating should be something we enjoy.\r\n\r\nToday I have a different approach to healthy eating. I’m far more flexible with my meals, and I understand that balance is key to being nourished and happy with food.\r\n\r\nHealthy eating now means that, most of the time, I make sure to have food from all food groups on my plate without measuring anything or thinking about plant-based vs. animal-based protein or simple vs. complex carbs.\r\n\r\nIt also means that I get to enjoy a bit of everything — including sweets, fast food, and desserts — with moderation and without the need to measure or account for it.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, finding the balance that worked for me didn’t happen overnight. On the contrary, my definition of healthy eating has been changing as I’ve gone through the different stages of my life.\r\n\r\nAs long as you aim to nourish your body and listen to what it needs, you can also give healthy eating your own meaning, because healthy eating is for everyone.",

The major reason which shall be taken into the account today is the education system of our country it is indeed great but there are some steps which can be taken to step up this journey of growing in our country.\r\nSince the very start after the-independence phase, the Indian education system has evolved a lot. At the time of getting independence from the British which was around 75 years ago the literacy rate was only 12% which has grown significantly today and become 74%.

Has the education system in our country not good enough to make us grow our country or it is just us?\r\nThese few are the reasons and solutions for the same how we can make improvements in our education system;\r\n1) from the very first start of school and in their upbringings, children are taught to have status in society which makes them fear failure and they do not even try to follow their passion and this can be the major reason that after completing12th standard which is hsc in India 70% of people go into the field of commerce/BBA but very few of them start their business majority of them gone on to do the 9-5 job hence it creates a shortage in employment and creates unemployment.",

However, unlike trying to lift weights or other workouts, it doesn’t feel like a full-blown workout thanks to the buoyancy. So your body is getting toned, but without any soreness. This is especially helpful for those who are frail. And this whole-body benefit translates into better weight management also, whether you’re looking to lose weight or just maintain your current weight. As both a cardiovascular and whole-body workout, swimming burns calories and tones muscle at the same time. These are valuable benefits from such a simple activity.\r\n\r\nAnd swimming is easy to get started. Swimming pools are everywhere, from your own house to clubs, gyms and community facilities. If you don’t know how to swim, or if it’s been a while, start slowly, just moving against the water by walking or gliding. You can build up as time goes on. And there are always swim classes and aquatic exercise classes to help you get started and get more comfortable.",

Rushing around making breakfasts and organising the kids? \r\n\r\nHow we spend the morning can have a profound effect on how we feel for the whole day. It can put us in a frazzled and frantic state of mind, or an empowered and calm one. So it pays off to create your own optimal morning ritual: your ‘power hour’ plan!\r\n\r\nWhilst you may not have a whole hour to yourself (let’s be realistic – it could be more like 10 minutes)\r\nBefore we dive into your power hour morning plan, we’ll explore the slightly geeky side of circadian rhythms and ATP production, as well as a more traditional Ayurvedic approach. Ready to power-up your mornings? Read on!\r\n\r\nDinacharya\r\nYoga’s sister science of Ayurveda has a rich and ancient history and a lot of useful advice we can use in modern life. One of the key aspects of an Ayurvedic lifestyle is rhythm. Ayurveda suggests cultivating a daily routine, known as a dinacharya. A dinacharya aligns with the energetic shifts throughout the day. It leans into the lightness of Vata in the early mornings, the steadiness of Kapha throughout the later morning hours, and the focus and fire of Pitta in the middle of the day. \r\n\r\nThese changes of energy throughout the day support different actions (see more in this article about doing yoga at different times of day); there’s an optimal time to wake, eat, work, play and sleep, and it’s all based upon circadian rhythms. \r\n\r\nCircadian Rhythms\r\nA scienc-y sounding word, circadian rhythms refers to the daily light-dark cycle, and the body clock. Throughout the entirety of human evolution, we’ve lived in alignment with the sun. We’d awaken around sunrise, and sleep not long after sunset (after a while spent sitting around the fire perhaps). \r\n\r\nThe more we reconnect to our natural rhythms and the arc of the sun, the more we support our health and wellbeing. Balancing our circadian rhythms requires that we wake up early, expose our eyes (and an appropriate amount of skin) to morning sunlight, and sleep when it’s dark.",

And Israel’s global role as a tech leader could be feeding into the increase in cyber attacks as well.\r\n\r\n“Israel has one of the most advanced security systems in the world,” Vishwanath said. “The attack on Israel perhaps means there may also have been a tech hack to suppress intelligence gathering, and alerts.”\r\n\r\nThe newsletter Cyberknow created a cybertracker that maps groups known to be targeting both Israel and Palestine. Its tracker currently notes 10 groups working on what it calls \"pro-Israel\" attacks and 48 groups labeled as \"anti-Israel/pro-Palestine.\" One of the groups, ThreatSec, claims to have attacked Israel in the past, but in a Telegram post, said it had recently gone after Gazan internet provider Alfanet.\r\n\r\nAlfanet reported to Wired that its headquarters and main tower had been completely destroyed by bombing but didn’t comment on ThreatSec’s cyber attack claims. Another group, the Indian Cyber Force, told Time it had shut down the websites of Hamas and the Palestinian National Bank on Sunday.\r\n\r\nHacktivists with the group AnonGhost targeted a missile alert app on phones in Israel, Cybernews reported, using the system to threaten a nuclear attack. In comments to the Washington Post, Alexander Leslie, a Recorded Future analyst, noted that such attacks are dangerous and disruptive, especially during war.\r\n\r\n“There are obvious security and safety risks for false missile alerts at a time like this,” Leslie told the paper. “It is a serious escalation in targeting and intent, regardless of its impact.”\r\n\r\nA Russia-affiliated hacking group called Killnet said Sunday that they would target the Israeli government, angry over the current round of violence as well as the country’s support for Ukraine. But as Truesec threat intelligence expert Mattias Wåhlén told Bloomberg, there might be a pecuniary interest involved as well.\r\n\r\n“Their actions look more like opportunistic strikes,” Wåhlén said. “The conflict creates headlines which attract groups like Killnet that try to monetize DDoS attacks.”",
